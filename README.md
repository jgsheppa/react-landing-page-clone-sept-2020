The goal of this project was to copy a webpage to the best of my abilities using React and CSS-in-JS.
The font is not identical, but I chose a font-family and style that was closest to the original website.

The links on my cloned page lead to the same links as the original page, except for the links in the footer.

Feel free to let me know what you think, or how I might be able to improve the project.
